Hi, I'm the front man from an Orlando indie punk band called the Dancing Bones. We play noise punk mixed with elements of psychedelia and Seattle grunge, and I'm reaching out because we're looking to play {{city}} some time in the next few months. Please check out our material at www.thedancingbones.com and let us know if {{label}} would be interested in having us up. We'd like to shoot for {{dates}}, but we're open any available dates you might have in {{month_range}}. Thanks!
