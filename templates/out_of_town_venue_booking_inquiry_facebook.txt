Hi, I'm the front man from an Orlando indie punk band called the Dancing Bones. We play noise punk mixed with elements of psychedelia and Seattle grunge. I'm reaching out because we'd like to book {{venue}} some time in the next few months. You can check out our material at www.thedancingbones.com. If you're interested, I'm considering asking {{local_band}} to play with us. We're open to any dates you might have available in {{month_range}}, but we'd like to shoot for {{dates}}. Thanks!
