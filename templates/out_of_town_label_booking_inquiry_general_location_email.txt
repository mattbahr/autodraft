Hello,

The Dancing Bones is an indie punk band from Orlando. We play noise punk mixed with elements of psychedelia and Seattle grunge. I'm reaching out because we are looking to get out of Orlando some time in the next few months, and I'd like to know if {{label}} would be willing to have us on a show. You can check out our material at www.thedancingbones.com. We are also on Facebook at www.facebook.com/skeletalwaltz.

We are interested in any dates you might have available in {{month_range}}, but I'd like to shoot for {{date}}. If that doesn't work, we'd be happy to pick another date.

Please let me know if this sounds good to you. Alternatively, if you have any shows in the works that could use an opener, we'd be happy to come out for that as well.

I look forward to hearing from you,
Matt Bahr
Guitarist/Vocalist
